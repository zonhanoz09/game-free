# Roblox UI

Implement deliberate, editable Roblox UI that preserves the experience's visual language and
works across supported devices. Targets Roblox's rolling platform APIs. Pair with `game-ui-ux`
for engine-neutral information architecture and UX; this skill owns Roblox Instances and APIs.

## When to use

- Use for authored `ScreenGui` interfaces, Roblox layout/constraint APIs, UI lifecycle, input,
  focus, animation, performance, or responsive/device fixes.
- Use to replace brittle pixel layouts, runtime-created Instance tangles, mouse-only menus, or
  generic generated styling with a maintainable hierarchy.

**When not to use:** general UX flow and accessibility principles belong to `game-ui-ux`; raw
gameplay action mapping belongs to `input-systems`; server trust belongs to `roblox-networking`.

## Workflow

1. **Inspect before designing.** In Explorer, inventory existing `ScreenGui`s, UI modules,
   fonts, colors, icon family, spacing, corners, strokes, animation timing, naming, and reusable
   components. Capture representative screenshots at two viewports. Extend that language.
2. **Define ownership and lifecycle.** `StarterGui` is the authored template; Roblox clones it
   into each player's `PlayerGui`. Decide whether each `ScreenGui` should persist across respawn
   with `ResetOnSpawn = false`; never keep stale references to a destroyed clone.
3. **Author a readable hierarchy.** Prefer meaningful editable Instances and small behavior
   modules. A normal screen should be understandable in Explorer; procedural generation is for
   genuinely data-driven repetition, not the whole shell.
4. **Build responsive structure.** Combine `UDim2` scale for placement with bounded offsets,
   correct `AnchorPoint`s, layouts, padding, content sizing, and constraints. Choose explicit
   narrow/wide arrangements instead of shrinking a desktop panel until it technically fits.
5. **Handle platform obstructions.** Keep interactive UI in `CoreUISafeInsets` (the recommended
   `ScreenGui.ScreenInsets` default), and account for touch controls and TV distance/overscan.
6. **Wire state and input.** Render from a small view state; update on events. Use `Activated` for
   `GuiButton`s, explicit selected states, and reachable gamepad navigation. Bind non-widget
   actions with `ContextActionService` only while the screen owns them.
7. **Polish with restraint.** Implement hover, pressed, selected, and disabled states. Animate
   state changes, not decoration; honor `GuiService.ReducedMotionEnabled` and clean up tweens and
   connections when the screen closes or is replaced.
8. **Verify the real interface.** Use Device Emulator and Controller Emulator. Test desktop,
   narrow portrait, mobile landscape, tablet-like, and console/gamepad; then respawn. Record
   clipping, overlap, text, scroll, safe-area, focus path, touch target, and lifecycle results.

## Production structure

```text
StarterGui
└── InventoryGui (ScreenGui; ResetOnSpawn = false)
    ├── Root (Frame)
    │   ├── Header
    │   ├── Content
    │   │   ├── CategoryList
    │   │   ├── ItemGrid (ScrollingFrame)
    │   │   └── DetailsPanel
    │   └── Footer
    └── InventoryController (LocalScript)
ReplicatedStorage
└── UI
    ├── Components
    └── Theme
```

Names describe roles, not colors or temporary positions. Keep repeated item cells as templates or
components, but keep the authored shell visible in Explorer.

## Patterns

### Layout that survives content and viewport changes

```lua
-- Authored properties on ItemGrid (ScrollingFrame):
--   AutomaticCanvasSize = Enum.AutomaticSize.Y
--   CanvasSize = UDim2.fromOffset(0, 0)
-- Children: UIPadding + UIGridLayout
local grid = itemGrid.UIGridLayout
local projectBreakpoint = 700 -- derive from where this composition stops being usable

local function applyComposition()
    local narrow = root.AbsoluteSize.X < projectBreakpoint
    categoryList.UIListLayout.FillDirection = if narrow
        then Enum.FillDirection.Horizontal
        else Enum.FillDirection.Vertical
    categoryList.Size = if narrow
        then UDim2.new(1, 0, 0, 40)
        else UDim2.new(0, 148, 1, 0)
    itemGrid.Position = if narrow then UDim2.fromOffset(0, 52) else UDim2.fromOffset(164, 0)
    itemGrid.Size = if narrow
        then UDim2.new(1, 0, 1, -52)
        else UDim2.new(0.58, -164, 1, 0)
    detailsPanel.Visible = not narrow -- open details as a separate narrow-screen state

    local width = itemGrid.AbsoluteSize.X
    local columns = if width < 520 then 2 elseif width < 820 then 3 else 4
    local gap = 12
    local usable = width - itemGrid.UIPadding.PaddingLeft.Offset
        - itemGrid.UIPadding.PaddingRight.Offset - gap * (columns - 1)
    grid.CellSize = UDim2.fromOffset(math.floor(usable / columns), 112)
    grid.CellPadding = UDim2.fromOffset(gap, gap)
end

root:GetPropertyChangedSignal("AbsoluteSize"):Connect(applyComposition)
applyComposition()
```

Use `UIListLayout` for one-dimensional flow, `UIGridLayout` for uniform cells, and
`UITableLayout` only when row/column alignment is truly tabular. `AutomaticSize` fits content;
`AutomaticCanvasSize` fits scroll content. Bound extremes with `UISizeConstraint`,
`UIAspectRatioConstraint`, or `UITextSizeConstraint` rather than one global `UIScale` guess.

### One activation path and explicit gamepad entry

```lua
local GuiService = game:GetService("GuiService")
local RunService = game:GetService("RunService")
local UserInputService = game:GetService("UserInputService")

local function openInventory()
    root.Visible = true
    task.spawn(function()
        RunService.RenderStepped:Wait() -- selection must be rendered and selectable
        if root.Visible and (UserInputService.GamepadEnabled
            or (UserInputService.KeyboardEnabled and not UserInputService.TouchEnabled)) then
            GuiService.SelectedObject = firstItemButton
        end
    end)
end

local function closeInventory()
    GuiService.SelectedObject = nil
    root.Visible = false
end

firstItemButton.Activated:Connect(function()
    selectItem(firstItemButton:GetAttribute("ItemId"))
end)
```

Prefer `Activated` over separate mouse/touch handlers. Set `NextSelectionUp/Down/Left/Right`
when automatic navigation is ambiguous, especially around grids, sidebars, and modals. A modal
must trap focus inside itself and restore a sensible selection when it closes.

For cross-device action binding, the Input Action System (`InputContext`/`InputAction`/
`InputBinding`) is the modern edit-time layer; see `references/input-navigation.md`.

Inspect Roblox's default selection adornment in context. If it overwhelms the interface, assign a
project-owned `SelectionImageObject` or selected-state treatment; keep it visible, valid, and
restrained rather than disabling focus feedback.

### State transition without animation noise

```lua
local TweenService = game:GetService("TweenService")
local GuiService = game:GetService("GuiService")
local fade = TweenInfo.new(0.14, Enum.EasingStyle.Quad, Enum.EasingDirection.Out)

local function setPanelVisible(visible: boolean)
    panel.Visible = true -- panel is a CanvasGroup
    if GuiService.ReducedMotionEnabled then
        panel.GroupTransparency = if visible then 0 else 1
    else
        TweenService:Create(panel, fade, {
            GroupTransparency = if visible then 0 else 1,
        }):Play()
    end
    if not visible then
        task.delay(fade.Time, function()
            if panel.GroupTransparency == 1 then panel.Visible = false end
        end)
    end
end
```

Animate a panel or state boundary once. Do not independently bounce every descendant.

## Visual quality gates

- Establish hierarchy through size, weight, contrast, grouping, and whitespace before adding
  decoration. Use a small spacing scale and align to it.
- Preserve the game's fonts, palette, icons, radii, and strokes. If none exist, define a compact
  token module; do not improvise per component.
- Use corners where the material/form calls for them, not on every nested `Frame`. Avoid nested
  card-on-card shells, universal pills, arbitrary gradients/glows/shadows, neon outlines,
  excessive transparency/blur, oversized headings, meaningless icons, and huge empty panels.
- Buttons with different importance should not look identical. Define primary, secondary,
  quiet, destructive, selected, pressed, hover, and disabled treatment only as needed.
- Motion communicates open/close, focus, confirmation, or spatial relationship. Keep it short,
  interruptible, and subtle; avoid perpetual motion and decorative tween chains.
- On touch devices, reserve the default movement/jump corners. Move or recompose bottom actions
  that overlap them, and hide keyboard/gamepad hints when those inputs are not active.

## Common failures

| Symptom | Likely cause | Remedy |
|---|---|---|
| UI disappears or duplicates after respawn | wrong `ResetOnSpawn` policy or stale clone | choose policy; reacquire from `PlayerGui`; clean old bindings |
| Phone layout clips | desktop offsets/global scale used as layout | add narrow composition, layouts, bounds, and Device Emulator checks |
| Content hidden under topbar/notch | insets ignored or `ScreenInsets = None` | use `CoreUISafeInsets` for interactive UI; inspect intentional bleed |
| Scroll ends early | fixed `CanvasSize` | use `AutomaticCanvasSize` or layout `AbsoluteContentSize` |
| Controller gets stuck | no entry selection or bad neighbor graph | set initial `SelectedObject`; define and test focus edges/modal trap |
| UI looks generated | decoration substituted for hierarchy | remove effects; align, reduce nesting, fix density and component roles |
| Explorer contains only one script | entire authored interface is procedural | author the shell as named Instances; generate repeated content only |
| Increasing connection/tween count | screen rebinds without cleanup | own connections per screen lifecycle; disconnect/cancel on teardown |

## Resources

- Read `references/responsive-layout.md` for layout decisions, inset policy, density, and the
  required viewport matrix.
- Read `references/input-navigation.md` when implementing gamepad/touch focus, modal behavior,
  action binding, or motion preferences.
- Build `assets/inventory-quality-test.project.json` with Rojo (it maps the adjacent JSON model)
  for an editable Instance fixture used in visual/layout review; it is a test baseline, not a style
  template for a shipping game.
