# Event channels & runtime sets (Unity 6.3 LTS ScriptableObjects)

Depth for `unity-scriptableobjects`: two decoupling patterns that are the main reason teams
adopt SO architecture. Verified against the Unity Manual ScriptableObject docs; the design is
original.

## Event channel (publisher/subscriber with no direct references)

A raiser (e.g. the player dying) and listeners (UI, audio, spawner) both reference a shared
`GameEvent` asset, never each other. Add/remove the asset to wire systems together in the
Inspector.

```csharp
using System.Collections.Generic;
using UnityEngine;

[CreateAssetMenu(menuName = "Game/Events/Game Event")]
public class GameEvent : ScriptableObject
{
    private readonly List<GameEventListener> _listeners = new();

    public void Raise()
    {
        // iterate backwards so a listener that unregisters in its handler is safe
        for (int i = _listeners.Count - 1; i >= 0; i--)
            _listeners[i].OnRaised();
    }

    public void Register(GameEventListener l)   { if (!_listeners.Contains(l)) _listeners.Add(l); }
    public void Unregister(GameEventListener l) { _listeners.Remove(l); }
}
```

```csharp
using UnityEngine;
using UnityEngine.Events;

public class GameEventListener : MonoBehaviour
{
    [SerializeField] private GameEvent channel;
    [SerializeField] private UnityEvent response;   // wire reactions in the Inspector

    private void OnEnable()  => channel.Register(this);
    private void OnDisable() => channel.Unregister(this);   // always unregister
    public  void OnRaised()  => response.Invoke();
}
```

Usage: the player calls `onPlayerDied.Raise()`; the HUD, the music manager, and the respawner
each have a `GameEventListener` pointing at `onPlayerDied` with their own response. Adding a
new reaction is an Inspector change, not a code change.

### Typed payloads

For events that carry data, make a generic base or a concrete typed channel:

```csharp
[CreateAssetMenu(menuName = "Game/Events/Int Event")]
public class IntEvent : ScriptableObject
{
    public event System.Action<int> OnRaised;
    public void Raise(int value) => OnRaised?.Invoke(value);   // e.g. score delta
}
```

Prefer a small number of concrete typed channels (`IntEvent`, `Vector3Event`) over a fully
generic `GameEvent<T>` because Unity cannot create assets for open generic types directly.

## Runtime set / registry (a shared, live collection)

Instead of `FindObjectsOfType` every frame, objects add themselves to a shared set on enable
and remove on disable. Systems (AI targeting, minimap) read the set.

```csharp
[CreateAssetMenu(menuName = "Game/Runtime Set/Enemy Set")]
public class EnemyRuntimeSet : ScriptableObject
{
    public readonly List<Enemy> Items = new();
    public void Add(Enemy e)    { if (!Items.Contains(e)) Items.Add(e); }
    public void Remove(Enemy e) => Items.Remove(e);
}
```

```csharp
public class Enemy : MonoBehaviour
{
    [SerializeField] private EnemyRuntimeSet set;
    private void OnEnable()  => set.Add(this);
    private void OnDisable() => set.Remove(this);   // keep the set clean
}
```

Now "nearest enemy" is a loop over `set.Items` — no scene scans, and the list reflects exactly
what is alive.

## Gotchas

- `List` fields on a ScriptableObject are populated at runtime and **persist in the Editor**
  between play sessions unless cleared. Clear runtime sets in `OnEnable` (or `OnDisable`) so a
  stale entry from the last session doesn't linger.
- Always `Unregister`/`Remove` in `OnDisable`; objects destroyed without cleanup leave null
  entries that crash listeners.
- Event channels invoke synchronously on the raiser's thread/frame — a heavy listener stalls
  the raiser. Keep handlers light or marshal heavy work to a coroutine.
