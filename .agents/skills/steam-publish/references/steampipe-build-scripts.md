# SteamPipe: advanced build scripts, branches, CI/CD, troubleshooting

Depth for `steam-publish`. Read this when one depot and a single `app_build.vdf` aren't
enough — multiple platforms/languages, file filtering, beta branches, automated uploads, or
a build that won't go through. All file formats are Valve **KeyValues (VDF)**. Verify against
the primary doc: Steamworks → SDK → [Uploading to Steam](https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/sdk/uploading).

## 1. App build script with separate depot scripts

For apps with several depots, keep the app script thin and reference one depot script per
depot. Convention: `app_build_<AppID>.vdf` and `depot_build_<DepotID>.vdf`.

```text
// scripts/app_build_1000.vdf  — game 1000 with a Windows depot (1001) and a content depot (1002).
"AppBuild"
{
    "AppID"       "1000"
    "Desc"        "1.2.0"
    "ContentRoot" "..\content\"
    "BuildOutput" "..\output\"

    // Optional top-level switches:
    // "Preview" "1"          // dry run: write manifest/logs, upload nothing
    // "SetLive" "beta-qa"    // auto-set live on this BETA branch (never "default")
    // "Local"   "..\..\ContentServer\htdocs"   // build to a Local Content Server instead

    "Depots"
    {
        "1001" "depot_build_1001.vdf"   // reference external depot scripts
        "1002" "depot_build_1002.vdf"
    }
}
```

```text
// scripts/depot_build_1002.vdf — file mapping, exclusions, and special file flags.
"DepotBuild"
{
    "DepotID" "1002"

    // Map a subtree into a folder inside the depot.
    "FileMapping"
    {
        "LocalPath" "bin\*"          // wildcards '*' and '?' allowed
        "DepotPath" "executables\"
        "Recursive" "1"
    }

    "FileExclusion" "*.pdb"          // drop debug symbols everywhere
    "FileExclusion" "bin\tools\*"    // drop a whole subtree

    // Mark files that the game/user writes at runtime so updates don't clobber them:
    "FileProperties"
    {
        "LocalPath"  "settings.cfg"
        "Attributes" "userconfig"    // user-modified: never overwritten, never flagged on verify
    }
    // "versionedconfig" is like userconfig but IS overwritten when you change it in the depot
    // (use only for genuine format changes/bug fixes).
}
```

Notes:
- `ContentRoot` can be overridden per depot inside a `DepotBuild`.
- `InstallScript "<file.vdf>"` marks and signs an install script the Steam client runs for any
  app mounting the depot (prerequisites, registry, shortcuts). Most games don't need one.
- You can name scripts anything; the `app_build_<AppID>` / `depot_build_<DepotID>` convention
  just keeps multi-app build machines organized.

## 2. Running builds (per platform)

```bash
# Windows
tools\ContentBuilder\builder\steamcmd.exe +login <account> <password> +run_app_build ..\scripts\app_build_1000.vdf +quit

# Linux / macOS (bootstrap once, then build)
./tools/ContentBuilder/builder_linux/steamcmd.sh +login <account> <password> +run_app_build ../scripts/app_build_1000.vdf +quit
```

macOS first-run bootstrap: `cd tools/ContentBuilder/builder_osx`, `chmod +x steamcmd`,
`bash ./steamcmd.sh`, then `exit` once it reaches the `Steam>` prompt.

## 3. Branches (betas) — test before customers see it

The **default** branch is what customers get. Always validate a build on a beta branch first.

1. Create a branch on the **Builds** page in App Admin. Use a name with **no spaces**; add a
   **password** if it should be private (players type it under *Properties → Betas*).
2. Upload your build (steamcmd, as above), or auto-target it with `"SetLive" "<branch>"`.
3. On the Builds page: select the branch in *Set build live for branch…*, **Preview Change**,
   then **Set Build Live Now**.
4. Opt in via the Steam client: right-click the game → *Properties* → *Betas* → pick the
   branch. Steam downloads it, replacing the installed branch.

Reminder: there is **no** way to auto-set the `default` branch live — promote a tested beta
build to default manually when you're confident.

## 4. CI/CD upload (token-based login, no password in scripts)

steamcmd stores a login token in `config.vdf` after a successful interactive login with Steam
Guard. CI reuses that token instead of a password.

1. On the build machine (or once locally), run `steamcmd +login <username>`, enter the
   password and the Steam Guard code, type `info` to confirm "connected", then `quit`.
2. **Preserve `<Steam>/config/config.vdf` between CI runs** (cache it as a secret artifact).
   This file holds the refreshed login token.
3. Subsequent runs log in with **no password**: `steamcmd +login <username>`.

```yaml
# GitHub Actions sketch — restore the token, then build. Never echo the token.
# Store the base64 of config.vdf as a repo secret (e.g. STEAM_CONFIG_VDF).
- name: Restore steam login token
  run: |
    mkdir -p ~/Steam/config
    echo "${{ secrets.STEAM_CONFIG_VDF }}" | base64 -d > ~/Steam/config/config.vdf
- name: Upload build to Steam
  run: |
    steamcmd +login "${{ secrets.STEAM_BUILD_ACCOUNT }}" \
      +run_app_build "$PWD/scripts/app_build_1000.vdf" +quit
```

- If a build run prints `Account Login Denied`, Steam Guard is blocking it. Run
  `set_steam_guard_code <code>` in steamcmd (code from the account's email), then retry login.
- Re-entering a password issues a **new** Steam Guard token and invalidates the cached one —
  avoid it in CI.
- Never print or commit `config.vdf`, the account password, or the Steam Guard code. Treat a
  leaked token as compromised and re-secure the account.

## 5. Patch-size hygiene (keep updates small)

SteamPipe diffs at ~1 MB chunk granularity and ships only changed chunks. To avoid bloated
updates:

- Don't compress or encrypt your own pack files in ways that cross asset boundaries — a small
  change then rewrites the whole compressed blob. Let Steam do compression on its side.
- Localize asset changes within pack files; avoid reshuffling asset order; keep pack files to
  ~1-2 GB and grouped by level/feature; add **new** pack files for new content instead of
  rewriting big existing ones.
- **Unreal Engine** pak alignment: build with `-patchpaddingalign=1048576 -blocksize=1048576`
  so re-alignments shift by SteamPipe's block size and patches stay small.

## 6. Troubleshooting table

| Symptom | Likely cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `Failed to get application info for app NNNNN` | Wrong App ID, account doesn't own the app, or config never published | Verify App ID in the script; confirm ownership; **Publish** the app config in App Admin |
| `ERROR! Failed 'DepotBuild …' status = 6` | Build account lacks permission, or `ContentRoot`/`LocalPath` is wrong/empty | Grant *Edit App Metadata* + *Publish App Changes*; check paths are relative to the script and contain files |
| `Account Login Denied` in steamcmd | Steam Guard blocking automated login | `set_steam_guard_code <code>` then retry; preserve `config.vdf` for future runs |
| Build uploaded but players don't get it | Build not set live, or set live only on a beta branch | Set live on the correct branch (default = manual) via the Builds page |
| Windows installs, Mac/Linux install no files | OS depots not added to the package | Add every depot to the package on *Associated Packages & DLC* |
| "Invalid content configuration" at launch | No build set live on the selected branch, or bad launch options | Set a build live; verify *Installation* launch options |
| Forgot a steamcmd command's syntax | — | At the `Steam>` prompt run `find <partial>` (e.g. `find build_installer`) to print matching commands + args |

Check the `*.log` files in `BuildOutput` (not the console) for the authoritative error on a
failed build.
