# three.js materials, lights & IBL reference (r155+)

Lookup tables and detail behind the materials & lighting skill.

## Material cheat-sheet

| Material | Lit? | Use for | Key params |
|----------|:----:|---------|-----------|
| `MeshBasicMaterial` | no | UI, flat color, billboards, debug | `color`, `map`, `wireframe` |
| `MeshStandardMaterial` | yes (PBR) | most realistic surfaces | `roughness`, `metalness`, `map`, `normalMap`, `roughnessMap`, `metalnessMap`, `aoMap`, `emissive` |
| `MeshPhysicalMaterial` | yes (PBR+) | car paint, glass, coatings | adds `clearcoat`, `transmission`, `ior`, `sheen` |
| `MeshPhongMaterial` | yes (legacy) | cheap shiny look, older tutorials | `shininess`, `specular` |
| `MeshLambertMaterial` | yes (legacy) | cheap matte | `color`, `map` |
| `MeshNormalMaterial` | no | debug orientation (no light needed) | — |
| `MeshDepthMaterial` | no | debug depth / custom depth | — |
| `MeshToonMaterial` | yes | cel-shaded look | `gradientMap` |

Default to `MeshStandardMaterial`. It responds to lights **and** `scene.environment`,
matches glTF's PBR model, and is the safe choice for imported assets.

### Common PBR intuition

- `metalness`: 0 for non-metals (plastic, wood, skin), 1 for bare metal. Avoid
  in-between values except for transitions (rust, wear).
- `roughness`: 0 = sharp mirror reflection, 1 = fully diffuse. Most real surfaces
  sit 0.3–0.8.
- Metals get their color from the albedo (`color`/`map`); dielectrics reflect the
  environment near-white.

## Light types

| Light | Direction/shape | Casts shadows | Notes |
|-------|-----------------|:-------------:|-------|
| `AmbientLight(color, intensity)` | uniform, everywhere | no | flat fill; no form |
| `HemisphereLight(sky, ground, intensity)` | sky-to-ground gradient | no | great cheap outdoor fill |
| `DirectionalLight(color, intensity)` | parallel rays (sun) | yes (orthographic) | the usual key/shadow light |
| `PointLight(color, intensity, distance, decay)` | omni from a point | yes (6× cost) | bulbs, torches |
| `SpotLight(color, intensity, distance, angle, penumbra, decay)` | cone | yes (perspective) | flashlights, stage |
| `RectAreaLight(color, intensity, w, h)` | soft rectangle | no | softboxes, screens (needs init helper) |

Since r155 lighting is physically based and the old `physicallyCorrectLights`
toggle was removed. Practical starting intensities: key `DirectionalLight` 2–3,
`HemisphereLight`/`AmbientLight` fill ≈ 0.5–1.5. `PointLight`/`SpotLight` use
inverse-square `decay` (default 2), so they fall off fast — increase intensity or
reduce `decay` if a lamp seems too dim.

### Shadow camera by light type

- `DirectionalLight` → `OrthographicCamera`; you set `left/right/top/bottom/near/far`.
  Fit it tightly; oversized frustums waste shadow-map resolution.
- `SpotLight` → `PerspectiveCamera`; `fov` follows the spot `angle`, aspect is
  automatic.
- `PointLight` → 6 renders (cube faces); only `near`/`far` matter, and it's the
  most expensive shadow.

Tuning knobs: `light.shadow.mapSize` (default 512×512; raise to 1024/2048 for
crisper edges at memory cost), `light.shadow.bias` (small negative to fix acne),
`light.shadow.normalBias`, and `renderer.shadowMap.type` (`BasicShadowMap`,
`PCFShadowMap`, `VSMShadowMap`). `PCFShadowMap` has been soft since r182, and
`PCFSoftShadowMap` now just falls back to it with a console warning. Visualise the
frustum with
`new THREE.CameraHelper(light.shadow.camera)`.

## Transparency & sorting

- Set `material.transparent = true` and `material.opacity` for blended transparency;
  three.js sorts transparent objects back-to-front, which can still mis-order
  intersecting geometry.
- For binary cutouts (foliage, chain-link), prefer `material.alphaTest = 0.5` with
  `transparent = false` — it writes depth and avoids sort artifacts.
- `material.side` = `FrontSide` (default), `BackSide` (interiors/skyboxes), or
  `DoubleSide` (planes, leaves).
- `depthWrite = false` on overlapping additive/transparent effects (particles) so
  they don't occlude each other.

## IBL without an HDR file: PMREM + RoomEnvironment

When you don't have an `.hdr`, generate a neutral studio environment procedurally:

```js
import { RoomEnvironment } from 'three/addons/environments/RoomEnvironment.js';

const pmrem = new THREE.PMREMGenerator(renderer);
scene.environment = pmrem.fromScene(new RoomEnvironment(), 0.04).texture;
// dispose pmrem when done if you only need it once: pmrem.dispose();
```

`PMREMGenerator` pre-filters any environment (HDR, RoomEnvironment, or a rendered
scene) into the mip-mapped format PBR materials sample for reflections at varying
roughness. Assigning the result to `scene.environment` lights every
`MeshStandardMaterial`/`MeshPhysicalMaterial` without adding explicit lights.

Pair IBL with tone mapping for a filmic result:
`renderer.toneMapping = THREE.ACESFilmicToneMapping` and adjust
`renderer.toneMappingExposure`.
