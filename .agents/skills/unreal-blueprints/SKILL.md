# Unreal Blueprints (Visual Scripting)

Structure gameplay logic in Unreal Engine 5 Blueprints: pick the right graph, expose data
cleanly, and choose a communication method that doesn't create hard-reference spaghetti.
Targets **UE 5.8**. (Blueprints are node graphs; the snippets below describe node flows.)

## When to use

- Use when authoring a Blueprint Class, wiring the Event Graph (BeginPlay/Tick/overlap),
  using the Construction Script, creating variables/functions/macros, or choosing how two
  Blueprints communicate (Cast, Interface, or Event Dispatcher).
- Use when the project has `*.uproject` and Blueprint `*.uasset` files, and the user works
  visually rather than in C++.

**When *not* to use:** performance-critical systems, large data structures, or anything that
benefits from source control diffs and unit tests → `unreal-cpp-gameplay`. Player input
mapping → `unreal-enhanced-input`. AI logic → `unreal-behavior-trees`.

## Core workflow

1. **Choose the Blueprint type.** A **Blueprint Class** (derived from Actor/Pawn/Character/
   ActorComponent) defines a reusable object. The **Level Blueprint** is a per-level graph for
   level-specific scripting only — don't put reusable logic there.
2. **Use the Construction Script for editor-time setup** (procedural placement, configuring
   components from variables) — it runs when the actor is placed or edited, *not* during play.
3. **Use the Event Graph for runtime logic.** `Event BeginPlay` for init, input/overlap events
   for reactions. Avoid `Event Tick` unless you truly need per-frame work.
4. **Expose data with variables**; click the eye icon to make a variable Instance Editable, and
   group related ones with categories. Mark **pure** functions (no exec pin) for getters.
5. **Pick a communication method by coupling** (see Patterns): direct **Cast** for things you
   own, **Blueprint Interface** to call across types without hard references, **Event
   Dispatcher** to broadcast one-to-many.
6. **Verify** with the Blueprint debugger: drop breakpoints on nodes, watch variable values,
   and use Print String to confirm execution paths during Play In Editor (PIE).

## Patterns

### 1. Reactive Event Graph (no Tick)

```text
Event BeginPlay
  -> Set 'StartLocation' = GetActorLocation
  -> Bind Event to OnComponentBeginOverlap (TriggerVolume) [calls custom event OnEnterZone]

OnEnterZone (Other Actor)
  -> Branch: Other Actor == Player?
       True  -> Open Door (Timeline drives the rotation)   // event-driven, runs once
```

Prefer events (overlaps, timers, dispatchers) and Timelines over polling in Tick.

### 2. Direct reference + Cast (tight coupling, use sparingly)

```text
Overlapped Actor (Actor ref)
  -> Cast To BP_Player
       Cast Failed -> (do nothing)
       Success     -> call BP_Player.ApplyDamage(10)
```

`Cast To` creates a hard reference to that class (it loads with this Blueprint). Fine when the
caller genuinely depends on that type; otherwise prefer an Interface.

### 3. Blueprint Interface (decoupled call)

```text
// 1. Create BPI_Interactable with function 'Interact(Instigator)'.
// 2. Add the interface to BP_Door, BP_Chest, BP_Lever and implement 'Interact' in each.
// 3. Caller, with any Actor ref:
Player presses Use
  -> Does Object Implement Interface (BPI_Interactable)?  // safe check, no Cast/hard ref
       True -> Interact (Message) on Target Actor
```

### 4. Event Dispatcher (one-to-many broadcast)

```text
// In BP_Player: declare Event Dispatcher 'OnHealthChanged (float NewHealth)'.
TakeDamage -> Set Health -> Call 'OnHealthChanged' (Health)   // broadcast

// In WBP_HUD BeginPlay: Bind Event to 'OnHealthChanged' -> update health bar.
// Many listeners can bind; the player never references them.
```

## Pitfalls

- **Cast spaghetti / long load times** — chains of `Cast To` create hard references that pull
  whole asset trees into memory. Decouple with Interfaces or Dispatchers.
- **Logic in the Level Blueprint that should be reusable** — it can't be reused across levels.
  Put it in a Blueprint Class.
- **`Event Tick` overuse** — every-frame nodes add up fast. Use events, Timers
  (`Set Timer by Event`), and Timelines instead.
- **Construction Script doing gameplay** — it runs in the editor on edit/placement; spawning
  gameplay actors or starting logic there causes editor-only artifacts. Init in BeginPlay.
- **Variable not visible on the instance** — toggle Instance Editable (the eye); to edit before
  spawn via Spawn node, also mark "Expose on Spawn".
- **Interface call did nothing** — the target doesn't implement the interface; use "Does
  Implement Interface" before calling, or use the Message version which is safe on non-implementers.
