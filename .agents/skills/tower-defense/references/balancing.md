# Tower defense balancing and pathing (depth)

Math and structures behind `SKILL.md`. Engine-neutral pseudocode. The numbers are starting
points; tune against playtests. For pathfinding internals defer to `game-ai`.

## 1. Representing the path

Three common approaches:

- **Fixed waypoints (lanes):** an ordered list of points; enemies steer toward the next one.
  Simplest, fully authored, ideal for lane defense. Most TD games use this.
- **Grid + pathfinding (A\*):** enemies path from spawn to goal over a walkable grid. Enables
  **maze TD**, where placing towers reshapes the path. Recompute paths when towers change and
  forbid placements that fully block the goal.
- **Flow field:** precompute one direction per tile pointing toward the goal; every enemy reads
  it. Scales to huge crowds (one computation for all enemies) — see `game-ai`.

```python
# Waypoint following (pseudocode): move toward the next waypoint; advance when close.
def update_enemy(e, dt):
    target = path[e.wp_index]
    e.pos = move_toward(e.pos, target, e.speed * dt)
    if distance(e.pos, target) < ARRIVE_EPS:
        e.wp_index += 1
        if e.wp_index >= len(path):
            leak(e)                        # reached the goal: cost the player a life
```

## 2. Tower targeting modes

Expose a per-tower targeting priority; it changes optimal play more than raw stats:

| Mode | Picks | Good for |
|------|-------|----------|
| First | enemy furthest along the path | default; stops leaks |
| Last | enemy least far along | feeding another tower / slows |
| Closest | nearest to the tower | short-range/splash towers |
| Strongest | highest current/max HP | focus tanks |
| Weakest | lowest HP | last-hit / efficiency |

```python
# Pseudocode. Filter to in-range, then pick by mode.
def acquire_target(tower, enemies, mode):
    in_range = [e for e in enemies if distance(tower.pos, e.pos) <= tower.range]
    if not in_range: return None
    if mode == "first":    return max(in_range, key=lambda e: e.progress)
    if mode == "last":     return min(in_range, key=lambda e: e.progress)
    if mode == "closest":  return min(in_range, key=lambda e: distance(tower.pos, e.pos))
    if mode == "strongest":return max(in_range, key=lambda e: e.hp)
    if mode == "weakest":  return min(in_range, key=lambda e: e.hp)
```

## 3. DPS and "can this lane hold?"

```
tower_dps        = damage * fire_rate            # shots/sec
effective_dps    = tower_dps * (1 - target.armor_reduction)
time_in_range    = path_length_in_range / enemy_speed
damage_dealt     = effective_dps * time_in_range  # what one tower does to one passing enemy
```

A lane holds a wave if the **sum of damage_dealt across all covering towers** ≥ enemy HP for
each enemy, accounting for how many enemies overlap in range at once (a single tower can only
shoot one target at a time unless it has splash/multi-shot).

## 4. Enemy scaling across waves

```python
# Pseudocode. Scale HP (and sometimes count/speed) so towers must be upgraded, not just spammed.
def wave_enemy_hp(base_hp, wave, growth=1.15):
    return int(base_hp * (growth ** wave))     # geometric HP growth

# Mix enemy types so one tower build can't answer everything:
#   fast/low-HP (rush slows), armored (counters low-damage rapid fire),
#   flying (needs anti-air), swarm (needs splash), boss (huge HP spike).
```

Geometric HP growth (~1.1–1.2× per wave) paired with a linear-ish income curve forces
upgrades. If HP grows slower than the player's income/DPS, the game trivializes; faster, and
it walls. Tune the two curves against each other.

## 5. Economy

Income sources and sinks must be balanced so the player is *almost* able to cover each wave:

```
income_per_wave = kill_bounty * enemies_killed + wave_clear_bonus (+ interest, optional)
spend           = tower_costs + upgrade_costs
```

- **Kill bounty:** gold per enemy. Leaks should cost income *and* lives so leaking hurts twice.
- **Upgrade vs. build curve:** make upgrades cost-efficient enough that "tall" (few upgraded
  towers) competes with "wide" (many cheap towers). Diminishing upgrade returns prevent one
  god-tower.
- **Interest/banking (optional):** rewards saving but can snowball; cap it.
- **Sell refund:** partial (e.g. 70%) so repositioning is possible but not free.

## 6. Leak / lives model

- Each enemy reaching the goal removes lives (often 1, bosses more). Game over at 0.
- Show a clear "lives" counter and telegraph the next wave's composition so players can prepare.
- A short build/prep phase between waves (or a "start next wave early" bonus) gives agency and
  pacing control.

## 7. Wave pacing

- Alternate pressure: a hard wave, then a breather, then a spike. Pure monotonic ramps exhaust.
- Telegraph specials (flying/boss) one wave ahead via UI so the counter feels fair, not random.
- Let players trigger the next wave early for an economy bonus — rewards confidence and speeds
  pacing for experts without punishing newcomers.
